                   Welcome to your SVN repository.

Please note: the web interface lets you browse the respository, but
if you want to add/remove/edit files, you need to use an SVN client. 
There are several available, but odds are you'll use the command line 
or an Eclipse plugin (like Subclipse).



(Yes, you can delete this file without breaking anything.)
