Greetings!

In addition to your SVN repository, all COMS 309 groups
have been allocated a MySQL database. If you don't need 
a database for your project, then you can ignore this.

=== Database Connection Details ===
server:		mysql.cs.iastate.edu
database:	db30923
username:	u30923
password:	zhrFVz7HW

If you are using the MySQL command line utilities, you
can connect to the server with the following command:

  mysql -h mysql.cs.iastate.edu -u u30923 -p db30923
  (You will then be prompted for your password.)
